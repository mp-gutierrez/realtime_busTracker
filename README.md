<h2>Title of the project</h2>
    Real-time bus tracker
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
    This project is an animation that, using data from the MBTA public API, displays a map with the real-time location of the line 1 buses.
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
    In order to run the program, all the files need to be downloaded into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. With the files in place, a simple drag-n-drop of the index.html file into a chromium-based browser will load it correctly.
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
    After properly loading the file, you'll see the real-time locations of each line 1 bus indicated by a blue marker. They are refreshed automatically every 15 seconds, but can also be updated with a click of the button on the upper-left corner of the browser window.
